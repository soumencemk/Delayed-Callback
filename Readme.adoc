= Delayed Callback API

An API that can register a delayed event and process that when delay expired.

== How to use

* 1. Use Maven and add dependency --
```xml
<groupId>com.soumen</groupId>
<artifactId>DelayedCallback</artifactId>
<version>1.0</version>
```
* 2. Register the callbacks using -

```java
DelayedCallbacks.registerDelayedCallback(DELAY_TIME,callback);
```

Thats it! When Delay is done, the callback api will be invoked automatically.
